# TankFire
this is a online shoot game, just like other.io game.

In 2016, I developed a simple .io shoot game with Unity(Mobile and PC),while the server I create with c++ and need to process
physics on the server, so you need to export the game scene physics to the server. And the server I use PhysX to load the 
physic scene and do the move and bullet shoot. It's hard to debug, to develop the server is not easy.

After that, I see the unreal engine4, I think it's time to use unreal engine 4 to develop .io like game, with unreal engine 4,
I can build the project to dedicated server, and this saved me a lot of time. this game should works on PC, mobile and HTML5.
Finaly I finished the basic game, and you here is the html5 version, you can use latest firefox to test [this game](http://50.116.0.118).
